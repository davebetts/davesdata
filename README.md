# davesdata
This repository contains the links to the other repositories that are my (davebetts') personal reference library.  I have generally tried to cite my resources, particularly when the script is only a modification of a script created by someone else.

Generally, these scripts were intended for the following uses:
* Specific research projects and data sets
* Examples of general data processing
  * Typically generalized versions of specific scripts found elsewhere
* Coursework
* Examples from tutorials
 
## R:
[General data processing tasks and examples](https://github.com/davebetts/Data-management-scripts/tree/master/R "R scripts")

## Python:
[General data processing tasks and examples](https://github.com/davebetts/Data-management-scripts/tree/master/Python "Python scripts")

## Climate & Streamflow:
[Scripts for climate and streamflow analysis](https://github.com/davebetts/Data-management-scripts/tree/master/climate_streamflow "Climate & Streamflow")

## WATS_USU:
[Specific scripts for the data sets used in my research at USU](https://github.com/davebetts/Data-management-scripts/tree/master/WATS_USU)

### Kriging and zonal statistics:
Three scripts which were adapted to be used in a series to complete kriging and zonal statistics on climate data over multiple time steps.  These scripts are identified in the [README file](https://github.com/davebetts/Data-management-scripts/tree/master/WATS_USU)
