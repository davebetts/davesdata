# davesdata
This repository contains the links to the other repositories that are my (davebetts') personal reference library.  I have generally tried to cite my resources, particularly when the script is only a modification of a script created by someone else.

Irrespective of the coding language, the scripts were intended for the following uses:
* Specific research projects and data sets
* Examples of general data processing
** Usually a generalized versions of specific scripts found elsewhere
* Coursework
* Examples from tutorials
 
## R:
General data processing tasks and examples

## Python:
General data processing tasks and examples

## Climate & Streamflow:
Scripts for climate and streamflow analysis

## WATS_USU:
Specific to the data sets used in my research at USU
